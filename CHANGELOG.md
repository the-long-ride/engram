# Changelog

## 0.0.1

- Added explicit agent skillset adapters for Codex, AGENTS.md-compatible agents,
  Copilot, Claude, Cursor, Gemini CLI, Cline, Windsurf, Antigravity CLI,
  OpenCode, and MCP-capable clients.
- Added agent-assisted `engram save` capture with no inline text. The agent can
  generate a concise rule, workflow/skill, or objective knowledge candidate,
  then the normal A/B/C approval gate runs before writing.
- Added `engram autosave` for long sessions with multiple proposed memory
  candidates behind the same approval gate, including `--file transcript.md`
  input and numbered approval for selected candidates.
- Added role metadata on save/autosave with `--role` and `--roles`.
- Added PowerShell support to `engram completion`, `engram -v`, short command
  aliases, and detailed `engram help <topic>` command examples and use cases.
- Added MCP proposal parity for auto-detected saves, workflow saves, roles, and
  autosave proposals.
- Added Markdown style validation before memory writes.
- Added safety, skillset, MCP, conflict-resolution, coverage, and package
  preview checks for the initial unpublished implementation.

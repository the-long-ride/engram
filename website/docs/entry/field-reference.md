# Complete field reference

This page is the canonical end-user field reference for every Entry Web UI input and control.

## How to read this reference

Each field lists:

- **Config key** — the key used in config files and the CLI
- **Control** — the input type
- **Default** — the safe default value
- **Risk** — `normal`, `caution`, or `risky`
- **Notes** — what the field does and when to change it

## Core {#core}

| Config key | Control | Default | Risk | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `enabled` | toggle | `true` | risky | Master switch. Disabling stops Engram behavior. |
| `scope` | select | `both` | risky | Save target: `workspace`, `global`, `both`. |
| `read` | select | `auto` | normal | When hooks inject memory: `auto`, `startup`, `always`, `manual`, `off`. |

| `global_path` | text | empty | risky | Filesystem path for global memory. |
| `default_profile` | select | empty | risky | Profile used when none is explicitly set. |
| `roles` | roles | empty | normal | Comma-separated role names for routing. |
| `theme` | select | `dark` | hidden | Internal/hidden. Not user-facing. |
